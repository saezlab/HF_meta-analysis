## Integrated spatial and single cell map of human myocardial infarction

### Abstract

**Background**
Emerging barcoding-based technologies allow us to profile the transcriptomes and genome-wide chromatin accessibility of single cells, and spatially resolved transcriptomes of intact tissue. In the context of myocardial infarction (MI), these technologies will help to generate detailed descriptions of the cellular and molecular mechanisms during remodeling that will eventually facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Here we present a multi-omics and multi-scale analysis of single cells together with spatial transcriptomics to map human MI at unprecedented resolution.

**Methods**
Eight left-ventricle samples of four HF patients and one healthy donor, over four different functional zones (ischemic, fibrotic, border, and remote zone), were profiled for 10x Visium spatial transcriptomics, single nuclear RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single nuclear Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin using sequencing (snATAC-seq). snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq datasets were integrated to identify the distinct cell-types that conform the adult heart. Then, we leveraged our cell-type annotation to estimate the cell-composition of each spot in the Visium slides, increasing their resolution. Additionally, we estimated the activities of transcription factors and signalling pathway activities in each spot of each slide to provide mechanistic descriptions of gene regulation that complement cell composition. To define functional areas and micro environments in the tissue, spatial patterns of gene expression were obtained for each sample. Finally we studied how the tissue structure influenced the location of cell sub-types and their gene expression using MISTy, a novel machine-learning framework that models spatial interactions.
 
**Results**
Integration of snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq datasets led to the identification of 11 major cell-types and 13 subtypes. Spatial mapping of cell-lineages showed that different cell populations of cardiomyocytes, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells are exclusively located in specific tissue areas of patients and conditions. Moreover, we showed that the spatial distribution of these cell-types can be explained by the expression of cytokines, extracellular matrix proteins and the activity of signalling pathways in their surroundings. Our results provide links between cell-composition and cell-function that couldnâ€™t be achieved from single-cell technologies alone and can be used to properly describe disease processes during MI.
