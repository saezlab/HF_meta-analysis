#### Gene Query

<br>Select genes of interest below to explore their role in the consensus signature of heart failure (HF-CS).</br>
Following results are presented:

- **Expression** of queried gene(s), as reported by single studies. Expression is displayed as t-value resulting from differential expression analysis.
- **Ranking** of queried gene(s) in HF-CS. The lower the rank the more consistent the deregulation of that gene was observed in all studies
- **Mean t-value** of queried gene(s) compared to mean t-value of all genes in the HF-CS
- **Raw data** of queried genes (from individal studies and from meta-analysis) to download
