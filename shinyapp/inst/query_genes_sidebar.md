#### Consensus HF transcriptional signature

Here you can query genes in the consensus HF transcriptional signature. You can see the t-values of each gene selected in all studies curated, how its mean t-value locates compared to all genes used and its ranking in the meta-analysis. The ranking of every gene is based in the p-value obtained from a Fisher combined test, the higher the rank the more consistent the deregulation of that gene was observed in all studies.
