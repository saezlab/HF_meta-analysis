#### Functional Characterization of the heart failure consensus signature (HF-CS)

Query signalling pathway activities ([PROGENy](https://saezlab.github.io/progeny/)), transcription factor activities ([DoRothEA](https://saezlab.github.io/dorothea/)), biological processes and miRNAs, that characterize the HF-CS.
